## IBDocuments Crawler

This is a simple crawler to get past papers from [ibdocuments](https://ibdocuments.com). To get started download the binary from the [releases tab](https://github.com/jakcharvat/ibdocuments_crawler/releases/) and run it. This will create a folder with the papers for the subject you chose in the same directory where the executable is (so most likely your downloads folder). This is a V1 so the downloading is pretty slow, either download in small batches or let it run overnight :)

Also, eventually I wanna be able to crawl more stuff than just past papers, but again, V1. 

If you want to check out the source code and contribute then it's that `crawl.ts` file (I know, the code is awful). If you find a bug please file an issue here in the repo or message me wherever you find me.

Hope you find it helpful
